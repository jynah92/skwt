Pressure - SKWT

Inside of your head is ruined
Hide yourself and it feels alone
Try to neglect all the pain you had enough

Hard to pretend to be good
Far from what I've been living for
Is there another way for me

No one will give a hand
Need to clean all this mess
All this mess

If you feel the pressure
Lay your heart
Keep the frame of mind
If you feel your gone
Remind yourself
What have I’ve become now

Cannot resist in this chain
Gonna make me dead inside
Try to living is the other way to die

Used to buried all your hate
Destructed and desolate
There's no way to feel alive in here

No one will ease the pain
Need to stop all this pain

If you feel the pressure
Lay your heart
Keep the frame of mind
If you feel your gone
Remind yourself
What have I’ve become

If you feel the pressure
Lay your heart
Keep the frame of mind
If you feel your gone
Remind yourself
What have I’ve become now
What have you became now
