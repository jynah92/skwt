Pressure - SKWT

Inside of your head is ruined
Hide yourself and it feels alone
Try to ignore all the pain you had enough

Hard to pretend to be good
Far from what I've been living for
Is there another way for me

No one will give a hand
Need to clean all this mess
All this mess

If you feel the pressure
Lay your mind
Keep your true self
If you feel you're gone
Remind yourself
What have I’ve become now

Cannot resist in this chain
Gonna make me dead inside
Try to living is the other way to die

Used to buried all your hate
Destructed and desolated
There's no way to feel alive in here

Nothing will ease the pain
Need to stop all this pain

If you feel the pressure
Lay your mind
Keep your true self
If you feel you're gone
Remind yourself
What have I’ve become

Pain, inside
Try to stop this pain inside
Pain, inside
Try to stop this pain inside

If you feel the pressure
Lay your mind
Keep your true self
If you feel you're gone
Remind yourself
What have I’ve become now
What have you became now

Pain, inside
Try to stop this pain inside
